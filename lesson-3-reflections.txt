When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever I want/need to share the work or collaborate with others.
  A remote repository can also function as a backup, I suppose.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling changes manually allows for more control over what files
  are maintained in your local repository. You might not necessarily
  want to have the changes someone else has made or to maintain a
  copy of every file that's in the remote repository. Manually pulling
  changes also allows you to pull only the commits you're interested in.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are for making a separate copy of a repository on GitHub; clones are
  local copies of Git repositories (including those that originate on GitHub);
  and branches are for generating and maintaining different versions of the
  same repository. Thus, forks are useful when you want to copy someone else's
  project and modify it (or you can conceivably fork your own repositories
  if you want to). Clones are useful for copying a project as it is, or if you
  want to make changes and not host them in a GitHub repository. Branches are
  useful for keeping different versions of the same project separate during the
  development.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Having the last known state of the remote allows comparing that state to
  changes that have been made since that commit, either in the local repository
  or on the remote (depending on whether you're pushing or pulling).
