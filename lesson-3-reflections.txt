When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Whenever I want/need to share the work or collaborate with others.
  A remote repository can also funtion as a backup, I suppose.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Pulling changes manually allows for more control over what files
  are maintained in your local repository. You might not necessarily
  want to have the changes someone else has made or to maintain a
  copy of every file that's in the remote repository. Manually pulling
  changes also allows you to pull only the commits you're interested in.
