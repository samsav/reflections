What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When a repository is initialized, a hidden directory called `.git` is
  created. The directory contains the necessary components and metadata to
  track changes in the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area provides an intermediary step to the commit process. The
  benefit of having such a middle phase is that when making changes to files
  or how the working directory is organized, you don't have to worry about
  only making changes that you want to commit right away or in a single
  commit. You can make various changes and later organize them into logical
  commits in the staging area.
